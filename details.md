# [JSON]Â² - the details

## Reserved values

[readme](README.md#reserved-values)

When these strings appear as the value
of a CSV cell, ignoring whitespace on the left and right,
they will be converted to their corresponding special
JSON value.

All letters must be lower-case. No
characters are permitted between the braces or brackets
for empty objects and lists.
